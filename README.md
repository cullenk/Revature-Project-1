<H1>Puppy Adoption App</H1>
<p>Created a Puppy Adoption App where the user could fill out a form to specify their preferences and have a database queried to return dog breeds best suited for them. They are able to choose one of those breeds, name the puppy and see the information in an adoption record table. A user can also perform basic CRUD functionalities and search, update and delete the records in the database.</p>

<ul>
<li>Defined application structure, classes, methods and services with Java code in the IntelliJ IDE.</li>
<li>Implemented a database of tables with appropriate fields and columns using SQL queries and the DBeaver tool.</li> 
<li>Established a connection to this database using Hibernate and wrote the necessary HQL queries within my Java methods.</li>
<li>Deployed a Tomcat server to host my servlets and JSP files that pull from my database and display my data.</li>
<li>HTML and CSS were utilized to format and style the information obtained.</li>
<li>Produced dispatcher servlets and redirected established parameters to the necessary locations so the data could be dynamic.</li> 
<li>Built tests using JUnit to run coverage on the methods defined.</li>
<li>Constructed an Azure Virtual Machine to host a contained Tomcat Server of my project.</li>
</ul>
